                <br /><br />

                SVRS is a service that allows deaf and mute people to communicate using video. When someone calls such person, call is redirected to a ASL interpreter who transcribes the call into a sign language video. This video can then be viewed by the person. 

                <br />

                My client was using their services. Unfortunately they only provided videos in wmv format which were not viewable on mobile. My responsibility was to create a system which could parse incoming emails from the service, download the video from their website, convert it to a proper format and optimize it for streaming to mobile. I setup the system from scratch using PHP for email parsing, video download and conversion queue management, ffmpeg for video conversion and Darwin streaming server for delivery.

                <br /><br />

Client had asked me to create a system where users could post their clothes

designs and other users will comment and vote on them. Users had the ability to 

reserve those designs on the site. If the design was popular and was converted to a 

product, the reserved orders were charged. 

I was entirely responsible for creating the system in Wordpress and integrating with 

osCommerce to allow uploading designs and then converting those designs to 

actual products in osCommerce.

Integration:</a> 

                <br /><br />
                Client needed a solution to collect traffic and income details for websites from

difference analytics and ad API, then combine them in a quick easy to read format. 

So a user could keep track of income and changes in income without looking at lots 

of different reports and using piles of spreadsheets. 

My job was to create version 1 of this tool which allowed anyone to login using their 

Google accounts and add websites to be tracked (Google Analytics Data and 

Adsense Data).

                <h4>PHP/ JS Tree view for 

large hierarchical

structures:</h4> 

                <br />
              Client had a service which allowed users to backup and manage files to cloud 

providers such as Amazon S3, Rackspace cloud etc.. 

I was asked to create a custom tree view component. It required reading the list of 

files along with their version information from compressed proprietary flat files, 

sorting them and displaying them to user to allow selection and restoring. 

I created a custom jQuery tree view component along with backend PHP service 

that parsed the list of files and sorted them using temporary file sorts and sent the 

data to front end JS for rendering tree.
